				<h2>About fest</h2>

			<p>
			What has adorned him all the past years is the fact that he was cheerful for all the cinemas of the world, for all relevant authors, but also for movies that will not be found on the cinema repertoire. The importance of the FEST is reflected in the fact that the Belgrade audience - with the films of some of the greatest directors of today, such as Teo Angelopulos, Bob Rafelson, Volker Slendorf, David Kronenberg, Ken Russell, Vim Venders, Kislovski, Hercog ... had the opportunity to meet for the first time on FEST.
Already the first FEST began to be quite spectacular; it found "Odyssey in the Universe" by Stanley Kubrick, "Naked in the Saddle" by Denis Hopper, the aforementioned "Mes" by Robert Altman, the films by Eric Romero, Louis Bunuel, Zivojin Pavlovic ... Although many, from nostalgia but rightly, consider the first edition of FEST unprecedented, the truth is that in the coming years we would watch films that will remain recorded in the history of world cinema in FEST in the coming years. In the history of the festival, numerous great actors and directors of the festival were also included: Marcelo Mastrojani, Harvey Caytel, Liv Ulman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Sofia Loren, Robert De Niro, Antonioni, Dzoni Dep, Milos Forman, Katrin Danev, Vim Venders , Abaz Kjarostami, Hana Sigula, previously mentioned authors Rafelson, Slendorf, Russel ... the list is very impressive, casual and long.
Since its inception, FEST has always had major and several accompanying programs, which by their quality often exceeded the name "accompanying". "Pratece" were also numerous publications, exhibitions, symposiums that were held during the festival.
So far, FEST has had about four million viewers and nearly 4,000 significant world films - who had a Yugoslav / Serbian and often a regional premiere on it.
Although the first FEST was held more than 40 years ago, this year with the same energy continues its big cultural and educational task for the film horizons to all fans of film art.
2015, FEST becomes a true competition with four competition selections: the main competition program - international selection, the program Serbian Film - National Selection, the program Granice - subversive and controversial films and films from the region that compete for the Nebojsa DJukelic award.
Another novelty is the introduction of the Belgrade winner award for outstanding contribution to film art, as well as the Belgrade winner for the past creative work.
