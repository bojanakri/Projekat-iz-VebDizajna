			Keira Christina Knightley, born on March 26, 1985, is an Englishman. She started acting as a little girl, and she celebrated in 2003 after her main roles in "Play as Beckham" and the trilogy "Pirates of the Caribbean". She then appeared in several Hollywood films. In 2005, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for the role in the film "Gordost i predrasude".
The tiniest woman lives in central London and is seen with a partner in "Gordost and Prejudice", Rupert Frend. She previously worked with Irish model Jamie Dornan, as well as actor Del Sino, who, according to some reports, tried suicide after their breakup, although both deny such claims.
The tiniest said she felt uncomfortably dressed up and that the Britons liked her more than Americans, because she believes that the British are less concerned about her looks. She denied rumors of suffering from anorexia, although she admitted that there was a history of her illness in her family; her appearance at the premiere of the movie "Pirates of the Caribbean: Secret Chest" has caused media speculation that her extremely fragrant figure has to do with food disorder. In July 2006, she said she believed she had become dependent on work, saying she had merged into one in the past five years. "I can not tell you what happened last year or those before," adding that she was doing too much and afraid she would, if she continued to work at the pace at the time, hate what she likes. There is the possibility that, for this reason, Littlest is pausing for one year to travel and focus on her private life.
Kira Knightley is a hot fan of the West Ham team.
