		<h2>FEST INTERVIEW: James Cameron, director of film Titanic</h2>
				
				<p>
				-In the film you do not show the events that happen to your characters, but they are persuading them to an unimportant man who offers solutions to all their problems. It is very ungrateful to cause the audience's feelings only by convincing certain situations. How did you work with actors on that skill?

Yes, this type of film is very unusual. As a director, I work on the principle that the audience can not see the script, but the actor has to document the entire film. In each of my films I spend a lot of time analyzing the screenplay with the actors, first individually, then shooting with the setting that works on that scene. I am always a screenwriter of my films, alone or in cooperation with someone, but I am the one who writes the story. I'm not starting to record while the script is not perfect. It's not that I do not like improvisation, but it's a side-by-side for me. Primarily I have to be sure of my scenario. Only when satisfied with it, if an actor proposes something different, changing a replica or situation, they can consider this.
 
-Film is interlaced with eleven parallel stories, does it mean you did not change the order of the scene in the assembling?
No, in the setup, we dropped and shortened some scenes, but the order remained absolutely unchanged.
 
- It took less than two weeks to notice?
It is very interesting that we worked as if it was a low profile movie and for me it was a kind of return to the past. We filmed the movie for thirteen days, the first 11 for the story of each hero, one day for the introductory cadres and the last day for the music spot for the title track of our film. My guess is made up of 11 phenomenal actors and I'm lucky that my first choices for these roles have accepted the work on the project even before they saw the script.
 
-This film is inspired by the American series "The Booth at The End". How did this transformation come about and do you plan on working on television series in the future?
When we thought about how to make a movie from this series, we watched every episode more than ten times. We closed some open prices that existed, because in this series not every character is fully processed and there are no ending stories. Also, some characters that were not interesting for our speech area were thrown out, and we introduced a couple of new ones.
I've recorded two series, one fifteen and another seven years ago. I just finished writing a new series that will be running in Italy, but I will not cut it. However, I love the film so much and every time I choose the next project and I have the choice between shooting a movie and a television series, I choose a movie.
 
-How much of a career in the marketing agency has helped you create movies?
In advertising, the most important is a well-designed story that you have to say in only 30 seconds, so I think it helped me most in creating a story in a synthetic way.
 
- What would you ask your chief hero, the mysterious man with the omnipotent sign, to have an opportunity?
Me? I love my profession very much, so I would ask for the possibility to continue to deal with this because it's not easy at all. In Italy, many filmmakers remain unemployed after filming the film. The message of this film is one of the replicas of Marsela, the elderly gentlemen in the film: There is something abominable in all of us and who does not have to face the challenges of his life has much happiness. I think that's right. Sometimes we feel that we are good people just because nobody put us in a situation to show our dark side. This movie motivates us to judge ourselves and our deeds.
 
- How did the audience in Italy react to the film?
The audience reaction is very good. We received eight nominations for the most prestigious Italian award, David Di Donatello. In cinemas, the film has already earned about five million dollars, which is a great success in Italy for the author's film.
